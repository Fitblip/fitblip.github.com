                <p>
                    I joined ThinAir as employee #5 early in 2015. When I came on board I was solely responsible for building the first few iterations of
                    the
                    backend with one goal in mind - bring ubiquitous encryption to the masses! Written in Django it is
                    the central
                    API consumed by our iOS, C++, .Net, and Java clients that we deploy to customer sites and is
                    responsible for
                    collecting file and security events from endpoints, as well as brokering the escrow of encryption
                    keys that
                    are stored in a "zero-knowledge" fashion.
                    <br><br>
                    With that I was also the founding member of the devops team, solely responsible for deploying our
                    software
                    until we brought on more backend developers and devops team members.
                    <br><br>
                    I was also the first member of the security team. I coordinated our first security review of our
                    entire product
                    end to end, and helped incorporate the fixes necessary for us to have a security report at the end of the
                    engagement
                    with no issues exceeding a <b>LOW</b> rating. I also helped coordinate our SOC II (type 2) audit,
                    which we passed
                    with flying colors.

                <p>
                    I joined the Palantir Infosec Engineering Team 6 months before I graduated (working remotely), then moved across
                    the country
                    to help defend Palantir's network from insider threats, state actors, and all sorts of nasty things.
                    For the first
                    year and a half or so I did a lot of different things, like get deployed to customer sites to conduct forensics and
                    present
                    evidence to law firms, conducting large-scale penetration tests in-house, and contributing
                    security improvements
                    to the core Palantir platform.
                    <br><br>
                    From there I lead the Internal Application Security Team efforts, which was responsible for
                    coordinating large scale
                    security reviews with external contractors, setting up security tooling as part of the build
                    infrastructure,
                    conducting internal security reviews and training, and contributing fixes directly to the core
                    platform.

                <p>
                    While attending university at Michigan Tech, I also worked as a linux administrator for the first
                    two years or
                    so, being responsible for thousands of machines across the fleet.
                    Security has always been an interest of mine, so along with my administration tasks I started
                    discovering security
                    issues as well as attackers within our infrastructure, and worked hard to mitigate them. Eventually
                    the
                    director of security took notice and created a job for me as the sole other security team member.
                    <br><br>
                    After that they basically just locked me in the NOC and told me to help find and mitigate any
                    security issues
                    that I could, which was an absolutely invaluable learning period for me.
